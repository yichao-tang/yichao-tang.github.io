Dear Professor/Doctor/Hiring Manager, 

I am very interested in the academic job opportunities that you offer. I am currently a doctoral candidate who will graduate in summer 2024, I hope to work as a teacher or researcher in a university or research institute, or as a postdoctoral fellow in your team. 

If you think I meet your requirements, I look forward to hearing from you.
