I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Multimedia & Artificial Intelligence Security Laboratory (MAS), School of Computer Science, Fudan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xinpeng Zhang](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/3f/d2/c25909a278482/page.htm) and [Prof. Zhenxing Qian](https://tomzqian.github.io/).

I obtained my Ph.D degree from South China Agricultural University (SCAU), where I studied Information Security and Digital Watermarking under the supervision of [Prof. Chuntao Wang](https://www.scholat.com/wangchuntao). Additionally, I was fortunate to receive guidance from [Prof. Kangshun Li](https://yjsglxt.scau.edu.cn/open/WxXlbs/TeacherInfo.aspx?jsbh=LiKangShun20). During my Ph.D studies, I visited Hong Kong Baptist University for academic exchange and collaborated with [Prof. Yiu-ming Cheung](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc).

I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from East China Jiaotong University (ECJTU). There, I studied Evolutionary Algorithms under the guidance of [Prof. Xuewen Xia](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/IOIP/people/50779). 

My research results have been published in several top-tier journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (T-IFS), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (T-CSVT), and Information Sciences (INS). I serve as a reviewer for many SCI journals, such as T-CSVT, Artificial Intelligence Review, Cluster Computing, IEEE Access and IET Power Electronics.

My research interests include robust watermarking, reversible data hiding, and AIGC security. For **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [yichao_tang@foxmail.com](mailto:yichao_tang@foxmail.com)
