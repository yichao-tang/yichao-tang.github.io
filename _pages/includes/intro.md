I am a Ph.D Candidate of [Prof. Chuntao Wang](https://www.scholat.com/wangchuntao) at South China Agricultural University (SCAU), and my research focuses on Information Security and Digital Watermarking. During my Ph.D studies, I visited Hong Kong Baptist University for academic exchange and collaborated with [Prof. Yiu-ming Cheung](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc).

I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from East China Jiaotong University (ECJTU), where I studied evolutionary algorithms under the supervision of [Prof. Xuewen Xia](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/IOIP/people/50779). 

My research results have been published in several top-tier journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (T-IFS), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (T-CSVT), and Information Sciences (INS). I serve as a reviewer for many SCI journals, such as T-CSVT, Artificial Intelligence Review, Cluster Computing, IEEE Access and IET Power Electronics.

My research interests include robust watermarking, reversible data hiding, and AIGC security. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me: [yichao_tang@foxmail.com](mailto:yichao_tang@foxmail.com)
